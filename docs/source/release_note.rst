Release Notes
=============

Release 0.11.1
--------------

AMD Quark for PyTorch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Model Support
"""""""""""""

Supported out-of-box model architectures:

-  Kimi-K2-Thinking, Kimi-K2-Instruct, Kimi-K2.5
-  Qwen3 MoE, Qwen3 Coder, Qwen3 Coder-Next, Qwen3.5/Qwen3.6 dense and MoE
-  DeepSeek-V3.2, DeepSeek-OCR
-  GLM-4.7
-  Minimax-M2.1

New Features
""""""""""""

-  Added File-to-File quantization for ultra-large models. This mode supports **weight-only quantization** and **dynamic activation quantization + weight quantization**, exports **hf_format** only, and can also accept pre-quantized inputs (deepseek-style FP8, compressed-tensors) and re-quantize them to a different format.

   For example, the command below runs file-to-file quantization to MXFP4:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python3 quantize_quark.py --model_dir [model checkpoint folder] \
                                --output_dir [output folder] \
                                --quant_scheme mxfp4 \
                                --file2file_quantization \
                                --skip_evaluation

-  Added a pre-quantization compatibility check for ``transformers`` in LLM PTQ workflows, and enabled dry-run compatibility checking by default with clearer error messages when model loading fails.

Bug fixes and minor improvements
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

-  Fixed weight calibration coverage to ensure complete calibration even for weights outside the forward path, and added token distribution coverage warnings during calibration.

AMD Quark for ONNX
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

New Features
""""""""""""

-  Support using a YAML file as input to perform custom preprocessing for float models before quantization.

Enhancements
""""""""""""

-  Memory optimization has been extended to all calibration methods, particularly further reducing memory usage during activation data collection.

Bug fixes and minor improvements
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

-  Infer kernel size from weights if the attribute `kernel_shape` of Conv nodes are not presented explicitly during fast finetuning.


Release 0.11
------------

AMD Quark for PyTorch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

AMD Quark 0.11 is tested against PyTorch 2.9, and compatible with upstream ``transformers==4.57``.

Fused ``"rotation"`` and ``"quarot"`` algorithms in a single interface
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The pre-quantization algorithms "rotation" and "quarot" are fused together into a single rotation algorithm. It can be configured using :py:class:`.RotationConfig`. By default, only ``R1`` rotation is applied, corresponding to the previous ``quant_algo="rotation"`` behavior.

Quark Torch Quantization Config Refactor
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

-  The quantization configuration classes have been renamed for better clarity and consistency:

   -  ``QuantizationSpec`` is deprecated in favor of :py:class:`.QTensorConfig`.
   -  ``QuantizationConfig`` is deprecated in favor of :py:class:`QLayerConfig`.
   -  ``Config`` is deprecated in favor of :py:class:`QConfig`.

-  The deprecated class names (``QuantizationSpec``, ``QuantizationConfig``, ``Config``) are still available as aliases for backward compatibility, but will be removed in a future release.

-  Before Refactor:

   .. code-block:: python

      from quark.torch.quantization.config.config import Config, QuantizationConfig, QuantizationSpec

      quant_spec = QuantizationSpec(dtype=Dtype.int8, ...)
      quant_config = QuantizationConfig(weight=quant_spec, ...)
      config = Config(global_quant_config=quant_config, ...)

-  After Refactor:

   .. code-block:: python

      from quark.torch.quantization.config.config import QConfig, QLayerConfig, QTensorConfig

      quant_spec = QTensorConfig(dtype=Dtype.int8, ...)
      quant_config = QLayerConfig(weight=quant_spec, ...)
      config = QConfig(global_quant_config=quant_config, ...)


``quark torch-llm-ptq`` CLI Refactor and Simplification
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The CLI has been significantly refactored to use the new ``LLMTemplate`` interface and remove redundant features:
-  Removed model-specific algorithm configuration files (e.g., ``awq_config.json``, ``gptq_config.json``, ``smooth_config.json``). Algorithm configurations are now automatically handled by ``LLMTemplate``.
-  Removed unnecessary CLI arguments, retaining only a dozen or so essential arguments.
-  Simplified export: The CLI now only exports to Hugging Face safetensors format.
-  Simplified evaluation: Evaluation now uses perplexity (PPL) on wikitext-2 dataset instead of the previous multi-task evaluation framework.

Code Organization and Examples Refactor
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Moved common utilities to ``quark.torch.utils``:

-  ``model_preparation.py`` and ``data_preparation.py`` are now available in ``quark.torch.utils`` for easier reuse across examples and applications.
-  ``module_replacement`` utilities are now located in ``quark.torch.utils.module_replacement``.

Moved LLM evaluation code to ``quark.contrib``:

-  The ``llm_eval`` module has been moved to ``quark.contrib.llm_eval`` and ``examples/contrib/llm_eval``.
-  Perplexity evaluation (``ppl_eval``) is now shared between CLI and examples via ``quark.contrib.llm_eval``.

Reorganized example scripts:

-  Removed model-specific algorithm configuration files (e.g., ``awq_config.json``, ``gptq_config.json``, ``smooth_config.json``). Algorithm configurations are now automatically handled by ``LLMTemplate``.

Extended ``quantize_quark.py`` example script and ``quark torch-llm-ptq`` CLI with new features:

- Support for custom model templates and quantization schemes registration (example script only).
- Support for per-layer quantization scheme configuration via ``--layer_quant_scheme`` argument.
- Support for custom algorithm configurations via ``--quant_algo_config_file`` argument (example script only).
- Simplified quantization scheme naming, directly use the built-in scheme names (see breaking changes below).

Setting log level with ``QUARK_LOG_LEVEL``
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Logging level can now be set with the environment variable ``QUARK_LOG_LEVEL``, e.g. ``QUARK_LOG_LEVEL=debug`` or ``QUARK_LOG_LEVEL=warning`` or ``QUARK_LOG_LEVEL=error`` or ``QUARK_LOG_LEVEL=critical``.

Support for online rotations (online hadamard transform)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The rotation algorithm supports online rotations, such that:

.. math::

   y = xRR^TW

where :math:`x` is the input activation, :math:`W` the weight, and :math:`R` an orthogonal matrix (e.g. hadamard transform). With the quantization operator :math:`\mathcal{Q}` added, this becomes :math:`\mathcal{Q}(xR) \times \mathcal{Q}(WR)^T`. The activation quantization :math:`\mathcal{Q}(xR)` is done **online**, that is the rotation is applied during inference and is not fused in a preceding layer.

Online rotations can be enabled using ``online_r1_rotation=True`` in :py:class:`.RotationConfig`. Please refer to its documentation and to `the user guide <https://quark.docs.amd.com/latest/pytorch/tutorial_rotation.html>`_ for more details.

Support for rotation / SmoothQuant scales fine-tuning (SpinQuant/OSTQuant)
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We support fine-tuning joint rotations and smoothing scales as a non-destructive transformation :math:`O = DR`, where :math:`R` is an orthogonal matrix and :math:`D` is a diagonal matrix (SmoothQuant scales), such that:

.. math::

   y &= xOO^{-1}W \\
   &= xDRR^TD^{-1}W^T \\
   &= xDR \times (WD^{-1}R)^T \\
   &= ... x'R \times (WD^{-1}R)^T

The support is well tested for ``llama``, ``qwen3``, ``qwen3_moe`` and ``gpt_oss`` architectures.

Rotation fine-tuning and online rotations are compatible with other algorithms as GPTQ or Qronos.

Please refer to the documentation of :py:class:`.RotationConfig`, `the example <https://github.com/amd/Quark/tree/release/0.11/examples/torch/language_modeling/rotation>`_ and `the user guide <https://quark.docs.amd.com/latest/pytorch/tutorial_rotation.html>`_ for more details.

Minor changes and bug fixes
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- Fix memory duplication and OOM issues when loading ``gpt_oss`` models for quantization.
- :py:meth:`.ModelQuantizer.freeze` behavior is changed to permanently quantize weights. Weights are still in high precision, but QDQ (quantize + dequantize) is run on them. This allows to avoid to rerun QDQ on static weights at each subsequent call.
- ``scaled_fake_quantize`` operator, which is used for QDQ, is now by default compiled with ``torch.compile``, allowing significant speedups depending on the quantization scheme (1x - 8x).
- An efficient MXFP4 dynamic quantization kernel is used for activations when quantizing models, fusing scale computation and QDQ operations.
- Batching support is fixed in ``lm-evaluation-harness`` integration in the examples, correctly passing the user-provided ``--eval_batch_size``.
- CPU/GPU communication is removed in quantization observers, allowing for faster quantization and runtime during e.g. the evaluation of models.

Deprecations and breaking changes
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- Quantization scheme names in ``examples/torch/language_modeling/llm_ptq/quantize_quark.py`` and ``quark torch-llm-ptq`` CLI have been simplified and renamed:

   -  ``w_int4_per_group_sym`` is deprecated in favor of ``int4_wo_32``, ``int4_wo_64``, ``int4_wo_128`` (depending on group size).
   -  ``w_uint4_per_group_asym`` is deprecated in favor of ``uint4_wo_32``, ``uint4_wo_64``, ``uint4_wo_128`` (depending on group size).
   -  ``w_int8_a_int8_per_tensor_sym`` is deprecated in favor of ``int8``.
   -  ``w_fp8_a_fp8`` is deprecated in favor of ``fp8``.
   -  ``w_mxfp4_a_mxfp4`` is deprecated in favor of ``mxfp4``.
   -  ``w_mxfp4_a_fp8`` is deprecated in favor of ``mxfp4_fp8``.
   -  ``w_mxfp6_e3m2_a_mxfp6_e3m2`` is deprecated in favor of ``mxfp6_e3m2``.
   -  ``w_mxfp6_e2m3_a_mxfp6_e2m3`` is deprecated in favor of ``mxfp6_e2m3``.
   -  ``w_bfp16_a_bfp16`` is deprecated in favor of ``bfp16``.
   -  ``w_mx6_a_mx6`` is deprecated in favor of ``mx6``.

- The ``--group_size`` and ``--group_size_per_layer`` arguments in ``examples/torch/language_modeling/llm_ptq/quantize_quark.py`` and ``quark torch-llm-ptq`` CLI have been removed. Group size is now embedded in the scheme name (e.g., ``int4_wo_32``, ``int4_wo_64``, ``int4_wo_128``).

- The ``--layer_quant_scheme`` argument format in ``examples/torch/language_modeling/llm_ptq/quantize_quark.py`` and ``quark torch-llm-ptq`` CLI has changed to repeated arguments with pattern and scheme pairs (e.g., ``--layer_quant_scheme lm_head int8 --layer_quant_scheme '*down_proj' fp8``).

- The token counter used count the number of tokens seen by each expert during calibration is now disabled by default, and requires the environment variable ``QUARK_COUNT_OBSERVED_SAMPLES=1``.

- The export format ``"quark_format"`` is removed, following deprecation in AMD Quark 0.10. Additionally, ``quark.torch.export.api.ModelExporter`` and ``quark.torch.export.api.ModelImporter`` are removed, please refer to the `0.10 release notes <https://quark.docs.amd.com/latest/release_note.html#release-0-10>`_ and to `the documentation <https://quark.docs.amd.com/latest/pytorch/export/quark_export.html>`_ for the current API.

      - Support Qronos advanced quantization algorithm.
      - Applying the `GPTQ algorithm <https://quark.docs.amd.com/latest/pytorch/quark_torch_best_practices.html#apply-quantization-algorithms>`_ runs x3-x4 faster compared to AMD Quark 0.9, using `CUDA/HIP Graph <https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html#cuda-graph-semantics>`_ by default. If requirement, CUDA Graph for GPTQ can be disabled using the environment variable ``QUARK_GRAPH_DEBUG=0``.
      - `Quarot <https://quark.docs.amd.com/latest/pytorch/tutorial_quarot.html>`_ algorithm supports a new configuration parameter ``rotation_size`` to define custom hadamard rotation sizes.

   -  QuantizationSpec check:

      - Every time user finishes init ``QuantizationSpec`` will automatically perform config check. If any invalid config is supplied, a warning or error message will be given to user for better correction. In this way, find  potential error as early as possible rather than cause a runtime error during quantization process.

   -  LLM Depth-Wise Pruning tool:

      - Depth-wise pruning tool that can decrease the LLM model size. This tool deletes the consecutive decode layers in LLM under a certain supplied pruning ratio.
      - Based on PPL influence, the consecutive layers that have less influence on PPL will be regarded as having less influence on LLM and can be deleted.

   -  Model Support:

      - Support OCP MXFP4, MXFP6, MXFP8 quantization of new models: DeepSeek-R1, Llama4-Scout, Llama4-Maverick, gpt-oss-20b, gpt-oss-120b.

      -  Supported users to specify a directory for saving cache files.

   -  Enhancements:

      -  Significantly reduced memory usage across various configurations, including calibration and FastFinetune stages, with optimizations for both CPU and GPU memory.
      -  Improved clarity of error and warning outputs, helping users select better parameters based on memory and disk conditions.

   -  Bug fixes and minor improvements:

      -  Provided actionable hints when OOM or insufficient disk space issues occur in calibration and fast fine-tuning.
      -  Fixed multi-GPU issues during FastFinetune.

Release 0.9
-----------

-  **AMD Quark for PyTorch**

   -  New Features

      -  OCP MXFP4 fake quantization and dequantization kernels

         -  Efficient kernels are added to Quark's `torch/kernel/hw_emulation/csrc` for OCP MXFP4 quantization and dequantization. They are useful to simulate OCP MXFP4 workload on hardware that does not support natively this data type (e.g. MI300X GPUs).

   -  Quantized models can be reloaded with no memory overhead

         -  The method ``ModelImporter.import_model_info`` used to reload a quantized model checkpoint now supports using a non-quantized backbone placed on  ``torch.device("meta")`` (`see PyTorch reference <https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/meta.html>`_) device, avoiding the memory overhead of instantiating the non-quantized model on device. More details are available `here <https://quark.docs.amd.com/latest/pytorch/export/quark_export_hf.html#loading-quantized-models-saved-in-hugging-face-format-safetensors-format>`_.

           .. code-block:: python

              from quark.torch.export.api import ModelImporter
              from transformers import AutoConfig, AutoModelForCausalLM

                 saved_format="safetensors"
              )

              # We only need the backbone/architecture of the original model,
              # not its weights, as weights are loaded from the quantized checkpoint.
              config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained("facebook/opt-125m")
              with torch.device("meta"):
